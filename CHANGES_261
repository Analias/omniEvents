 o Fixed SEGV in ProxyPullConsumer when its peer disconnects uncleanly
   or throws an exception.
   Thanks to Dirk Siebnich for reporting this bug.

 o New EventChannel parameter `PullRetryPeriod_ms' supercedes `PullRetryPeriod'.
   The new parameter is set by `eventc -R'. The old parameter and its `-r'
   option still work as before, for backwards compatibility.

 o All necessary header files are now installed, previously the header files
   for libomniEvents.so were not installed.

   All IDL and header files are now installed into omniEvents subdirectories.
   E.g. /usr/local/include/omniEvents /usr/local/share/idl/omniEvents. This
   makes the installation much simpler BUT it breaks backwards compatibility.
   
   To preserve backwards compatibility, the old headers are still installed.
   Don't use them! They will be removed in a future version.
   
   Stub header files are now generated with the omniidl option: -Wbuse_quotes

 o Sys-V configuration file is now installed into /etc/default or
   /etc/sysconfig, whichever is appropriate.

 o Makefiles now use $(DESTDIR) variable. Allows for installation somewhere
   other than the final destination. Thanks to Wolfgang Borgert.
   E.g. make DESTDIR=/mnt/ install

 o New configure option: --enable-unloadable-stubs. Turns on omniORB4's
   unloadable stubs define, for shared libraries that need to be safely
   unloadable. Thanks to Dirk Siebnich.
   
 o pkg-config file omniEvents.pc is now installed in ${prefix}/lib/pkgconfig
   Thanks to Dirk Siebnich.

 o RPM spec is now available in contrib/omniEvents.spec
   To build an RPM, use: rpm -ta omniEvents-XXX.tar.gz
   Thanks to Dirk Siebnich.
