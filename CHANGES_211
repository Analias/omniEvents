Changes since 2.1.1
-------------------

1. Bugs fixed.

  - Corrected build problem caused by incorrect symbol in oep_types.h
  - Corrected build problem caused by incorrect symbol in
    EventChannelFactory_i.h

2. Known Issues

  - The DLL produced for x86_nt_4.0 is incomplete. When linking against it
    you need to also include the EventChannelAdminSK.o and CosLifeCycleSK.o
    stub objects. For more details see the dir.mk file in src/sharedlib.

  - In agent mode (ie with only PushConsumers and PullSuppliers connected to
    an event channel) the response of the event channel degrades considerably
    if a PullSupplier is unreachable (eg COMMS_FAILURE). The reason for this is
    that the polling is done sequentially in one thread. There is a plan to
    change it so that each ProxyPullConsumer polls in its own thread.
