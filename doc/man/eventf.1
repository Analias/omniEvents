.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBeventf\fR establishes a connection between two event channels\&. The event channels must both already be in existence (perhaps created by the \fBeventc\fR command)\&. If both event channels are implemented by omniEvents, then the connection is persistent: it will be recreated if one or both of the channels is shut down and later restarted\&.

.PP
The from\- and to\-channels must be specified as URIs\&. This may be an IOR, or a corbaloc::: or corbaname::: URI\&.

.PP
Example: \fBeventf corbaname::#from\&.channel corbaname::#to\&.channel\fR

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.TP
OMNIORB_CONFIG
The location of the omniORB configuration file\&.
