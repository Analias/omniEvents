.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBevents\fR streams events from an event channel to standard output, or (\fB\-s\fR) from standard input to an event channel\&.

.PP
Events are streamed in raw binary form, accompanied by a timestamp\&. When the stream is played back into a channel, the timestamps are used the replicate the original delays between the messages\&.

.PP
The main use for this command it to record sets of events and play them back later for testing\&.

.PP
Recording example: \fBevents corbaname::#EventChannel > test\&.dat\fR

Playback example: \fBevents \-s corbaname::#EventChannel < test\&.dat\fR
