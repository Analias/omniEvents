RELEASE 2.4 (AUTOCONF)
======================

This is a port of omniEvents 2.1.2 to an autoconf build environment. It
preserve the exact functionality of 2.1.2, in order to keep changes
in the build system separate from functional changes. There have been some
minor changes to the text of error messages, in order to enhace usability.


Features:

 o  `make install' installs omniEvents into the proper local directory
    (/usr/local by default).

 o  Auto detects omniORB3 and omniORB4.
 
 o  Auto detects C++ compiler shared library compile/build options.

 o  Auto detects C++ STL and iostream features.
 
 o  Tested on a variety of platforms:

      Windows 2000 / Visual C++ 6.0 
      AIX 5.1 / xlC_r 5.0               
      HPUX 11.00 / aCC A.03.37           
      Linux x86, Debian 3.1 / g++ 2.95.4
      Solaris 2.8 / CC 5.3              
      Tru64 4.0F / cxx 6.2

 o  New Python versions of example programs (in examples/python directory).

 o  Windows binaries now available.


Changes:

  Virtually all `#include's have been wrapped in autoconf-generated
  preprocessor macro guards. These have almost completely replaced platform
  specific switches.

  Only the file src/omniEventsLog.cc still contains a significant number of
  platform specific switches. This file has been extensively re-factored,
  but it still needs work ;-(

  Manual configuration of a few esoteric values has been moved from
  config/config.mk to include/config.h.

  New output() member functions. Eliminates the need for friend ostream
  functions that are problematic on earlier versions of Microsoft
  VisualC++
  
  Updated License to GNU Lesser GPL v2.1. Included LICENSE file in
  distribution.
  
  Removed files:
    config/config.mk
    README.hpux11       - now builds out of the box on HP-UX11
    README.win32        - no longer relevant
    dir.mk              - not used by new build system
    GNUmakefile         - not used by new build system
    idl/Naming.idl      - now use COS/CosNaming.idl

  Added files:
    configure           - main auto configuration script.
    config.mk.in        - template for config.mk file.
    include/config.h.in - template for include/config.h file.
    Makefile            - in each build directory.
    LICENSE
    win32/*             - windows build files.
    examples/python/*   - python port of examples programs.

  Autoconf files (used by configure - just leave them alone):
    auto/*


Autoconf:

  The following file are used by autoconf to generate the configure script.
    configure.ac
    aclocal.d/*
  
  To regenerate the `configure' script, run the following commands:
  
  % aclocal -I aclocal.d  # Reads the contents of `aclocal.d'.
  % autoheader            # Generates `include/config.h'.
  % autoconf              # Generates `configure'.
