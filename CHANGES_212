Release Notes for 2.1.2  (19th February 2003)
=======================

This is a minor release to enable omniEvents to build
with both omniORB3 and omniORB4 using the old build system.

The last release of omniEvents was 2.1.1 (13th October 2000).

The source code distribution for omniEvents 2.1.2 is available at :

http://sourceforge.net/projects/omnievents/


Changes since 2.1.1
-------------------

1. Added support for omniORB4

2. Known Issues

  - The DLL produced for x86_nt_4.0 is incomplete. When linking against it
    you need to also include the EventChannelAdminSK.o and CosLifeCycleSK.o
    stub objects. For more details see the dir.mk file in src/sharedlib.

  - In agent mode (ie with only PushConsumers and PullSuppliers connected to
    an event channel) the response of the event channel degrades considerably
    if a PullSupplier is unreachable (eg COMMS_FAILURE). The reason for this is
    that the polling is done sequentially in one thread. There is a plan to
    change it so that each ProxyPullConsumer polls in its own thread.
